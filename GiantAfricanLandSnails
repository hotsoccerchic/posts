permalink: /www.turbobubble.com/GiantAfricanLandSnails

In 1966, a boy brought three giant African land snails into Florida. 
His grandmother released them into a garden which resulted in a population explosion of more than 18,000 giant African land snails 7 years later. 

It took 10 years to eradicate them at a cost of $1,000,000.
